# Survey simple page

## Description

Simple one-page survey study on physical activity and shopping habits.

## What was used?

HTML, CSS and VS Code.

## References

This single page was created from scratch based on the <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css/lessons/css-display-positioning/exercises/review-css-display-positioning" target="_blank">Codecademy course CSS module</a>.

Sometimes it was necessary to consult the course code, but I realize that I had no difficulty coding at least 70% by myself.
